# rgo

`rgo` is a **work-in-progress** (i.e. unfinished) Go compiler, written
in Rust.

For now, this is primarily a fun learning project.

I chose Go as the source language because C compilers have been written over and
over, and I wanted to do something new. Go's spec is pretty simple, so it seemed
like a good choice. The fact that is has a GC also makes implementing a compiler
for it more challenging and, therefore, more interesting.

Additionally, Go's reference implementation uses a custom backend for
optimization and codegen, while `rgo` will use LLVM for optimization and machine
code generation.
